# Development

Clone the repository from [Github](https://github.com/genesys-ui/icons).

```js
git clone git@github.com:genesys-ui/icons.git
```

## Installation

First install the dependencies

```js
cd /path/to/icons
pnpm install
```

## Generate the icons

Once installed the library, you will need to generate the icons.
Run the follo command to generate icons for react and icons as a font.

```js
pnpm run generate
```

Or if you only want to generate icons for a particular case, run one of the
following commands:

```js
// for react
pnpm run generate:react
// for font
pnpm run generate:font
```

Sometimes you will need to removed these files to work with a clean directory.

```js
// for react
pnpm run clean:react
// for font
pnpm run clean:font
```

Or if you need to remove all directories generated for development run:

```js
pnpm run clean
```

> _Note_: After run this command you will need to install the package.

## Development enviroment

Once you have installed and generated the icons, you can run a storybook to preview the output.

```js
pnpm run start
```

## Tests

To check any change ensure to run the tests.

```js
pnpm run test
```

Optionally, you can run stryker to ensure the coverage of the tests.

```js
pnpm run stryker
```
